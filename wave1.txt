# Information about a wave.  Each line contains:
# Path number, Invader type, time to wait before next invader is created.
# Path number is just an integer: if there is only 1 path in this level, then it should be 1; if
#   there are 2 paths, the number should be 1 or 2.
# Invader type is a string: "Ogre", "Troll", "A", "B".  The code needs to know what to look for.
# Time is in milliseconds. So, 1000 means after issuing this invader, wait 1 second before the
#   next one is issued.  Can use 0 to create multiple invaders at the same time.
